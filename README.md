# Pokemon-Revolution-Online-Bot
Used Image recognition and Natural Language Processing to make this bot in Python.

Making Use of Python's Library PyAutoGui and some NLP using CV2 created an automation farming bot. Can work on any dimension since I used image recognition.

What the Bot can do curretly:
- Has the ability to farm at mt moon
- Can goto mt moon and back.
- Can goto poke center if your pokemon has fainted.
- Will use another move (second move) if your PowerPoints have ran out.
